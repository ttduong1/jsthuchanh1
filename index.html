    <p>Mimikyu is a small Pok√©mon, standing 8 inches (0.2 m) tall, and is hidden underneath an old rag-like disguise.
         It has beady black eyes that can be seen in the lower area of its costume, and a vague semblance of a lower body can be seen at its costume's hem.
          It will occasionally extend a black appendage from beneath the disguise, which has black eyes, red cheeks, a black mouth, a lightning bolt-shaped stick that resembles a tail, and ears that are black on the top.
           In an effort to emulate the popularity of Pikachu, Mimikyu wears its Pikachu costume in order to make friends.[2] Mimikyu is drawn to dark or dimly lit areas, and its health will decline if exposed to sunlight.[2]</p>
